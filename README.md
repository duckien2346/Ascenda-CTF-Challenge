# Assignment: Cloud Security Challenge

It is really a great pleasure to have a chance on this challenge to learn more about cloud security.
Thank you Ascenda Loyalty for providing a lesson through this challenge.

## Solution

The solution is based on [https://loyalty.dev/posts/rails-to-the-cloud](https://loyalty.dev/posts/rails-to-the-cloud) written by **Rouvin Erh**

The key idea is from this line of code in `pages_controller.rb`:

```ruby
    image = (anya_path + params.fetch(:img, 'anya.png')).gsub("../", "")
    file = File.open(image)
```

Even though, using `gsub("../", "")` to prevent Path Traversal, it is still possible to access the parent directory by using `....//` instead of `../`.
